<p>The purpose of this project is to develop an experimental 
responsive website using a front-end framework. As a beginner 
in front-end website development, this was challenging. First, 
I needed to figure out what this meant and how to address it 
on my website. This was linked to Eleventy's JavaScript, which 
was first difficult to install. However, while examining the 
project 2 assignment details, I clicked on the link for Static 
Site Generators and understood from there. The main objective
is to apply CSS abilities to think beyond the grid and develop 
a basic experimental responsive website using a front-end 
framework. Within this, we were encouraged to design our own 
themes, and I chose to focus on a contour online artist named 
'Louise Weaver,' who appeared in the 2019 festivals. From there, 
developing a low-fidelity prototype for my website aided me in 
determining where to begin. I was delighted to design a layout 
that was identical to the prototype, since I had learned from 
the last project to keep the prototype simple and uncomplicated. 
The concept of this website is extremely straightforward, with 
dark colours such as red and black being used. The purpose is 
to make the website appear professional to users. As a result, 
these readers are likely to be professionals in their twenties 
or older who are seeking for a media developer to work for their 
company. In addition, I felt compelled to construct a website 
that was diametrically opposed to my first. This was accomplished 
successfully since each element and grid in the 'Louise Weaver' 
portfolio is distinct and has a specific purpose.<p>

<p>Since I had a better understanding of html and CSS coding this 
time, the process of constructing Project 2's website was faster 
and easier. Nonetheless, there may be a few elements I would change 
to improve this website. They involve adding more pages to my website, 
such as a subscribe page. Furthermore, raise the interest in Weavers' 
work by adding additional photos to my website. Cleaning up my CSS 
and adding additional media coding to create a smooth flow for the 
media side of my website in the future. In general, tutorials, 
inspiration from existing websites, and html and css coding knowledge 
all aided in the construction of my front-end framework website.<p>
